# FailureSense
### Industrial Risk-Aware Maintenance Intelligence

FailureSense is an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting industrial machine failures and supporting maintenance decision-making using risk-aware classification techniques.

The project is designed to bridge academic machine learning concepts with industry-oriented engineering practices, including structured experimentation, clean version control, and eventual deployment as a usable system.

## Project Status
Currently in setup and data understanding phase. Initial experiments and analysis are being developed using Jupyter notebooks, with reusable logic to be modularized as the project progresses.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets (raw data excluded from version control)
- `notebooks/` – Lab-wise exploratory analysis and experiments
- `src/` – Reusable preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation logic
- `app/` – Application and deployment components (to be added)

## Notes
This repository is under active development. The structure and contents will evolve incrementally as new labs and features are implemented.
