FailureSense is an end-to-end machine learning system built to predict rare industrial machine failures and convert probabilistic outputs into actionable, risk-aware maintenance decisions.

It demonstrates production-focused ML engineering practices like calibrated classification, recall-first threshold tuning, modular inference pipelines, FastAPI deployment, and a React + Vite dashboard integration.

### ✨ Key Features

* Calibrated failure probability prediction (rare-event focused)
* Recall-first threshold tuning for safety-sensitive environments
* Two-stage design: Prediction (Stage 1) + Decision Intelligence (Stage 2)
* Sensor anomaly detection + stress score computation
* Risk stratification: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
* Human-readable explanation engine
* Actionable maintenance recommendations
* Clean REST API contract for frontend integration
* Modular production inference pipeline under \`src/\`

---

### 🧠 Problem Statement

Industrial machines generate continuous telemetry, but failures are rare and extremely costly. Traditional rule-based monitoring often:

* miss early failure signals
* trigger excessive false alarms
* lack interpretability
* provide no structured decision support

FailureSense addresses this by combining statistical learning with operational risk intelligence to guide maintenance decisions.

## 🧩 System Design

### 🟢 Stage 1 - Failure Probability Estimation

Champion model: Gradient Boosting Classifier

* probability calibration applied
* optimized for rare-event recall
* cost-sensitive threshold tuning
* outputs calibrated failure probability

Answers: "How likely is this machine to fail?"

---

### 🟡 Stage 2 - Operational Risk Intelligence

Stage 2 converts statistical probability into structured decision support:

* sensor anomaly detection
* stress score computation
* risk stratification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
* explanation engine (human-readable)
* actionable maintenance recommendations

Answers: "What does this mean operationally, and what should we do?"

## 🏗 System Architecture

React Frontend (Vite)  
↓  
FastAPI Backend  
↓  
Production Inference Pipeline (\`src/\`)  
↓  
Calibrated Model Artifacts (\`models/\`)

Architecture principles:

* clear separation between UI, API, and ML logic
* model artifacts versioned independently
* business logic decoupled from statistical prediction
* REST-based communication
* scalable structure suitable for containerization
